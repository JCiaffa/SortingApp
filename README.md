A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. 
The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexigraphical order, and either ascending or descending. 
Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms that require input data to be in sorted lists.

Sorting algorithms can be classified in a number of ways including computational complexity, 
memory usage, stability, or by the general method in which they sort data.

This project focuses on visualizing the way various sorting algorithms sort a random array of integers, 
however, these algorithms can be adapted to sort a wide variety of data types. 

React was used as a framework for this project and Redux was used as a reducer in order to update component props for visualization.
